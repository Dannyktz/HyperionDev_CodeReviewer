Aspects that can be improved : 

Unfortunately, your code does not run .
In line 25 you return the recursive function but with the incorrect function name
At your Fibonacci function, it should take in an integer not a <T> (unknown), and also a descriptive function name using UpperCamelCase.
line 30 you have an integer the same name as your parameter , this will also cause overriding .
At your main function , instead of calling your Fibonacci function , you printed the first 10 numbers out .
Please also remove all testing code (line 24 print )

Positive aspects :

Good effort.
You are definitely on the right track , your documentation is spot on and your structure of coding is excellent.
You clearly understand recursion and how to use functions.

Overall Feedback :

Great work , just some aspects that need to be changed then program will work perfectly 
Keep up the good work !
